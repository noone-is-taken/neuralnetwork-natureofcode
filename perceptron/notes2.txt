Perceptron 2 

Classic is a algortihm that thanks to a training can learn to destingue two differnet type of inputs (this case is based on their position)

in this file we cover

1. change point x and y to be between -1,1

2. the habiliti to change the label condition ( basicily make a generic formula of a line like y = 3x +2)
here we need a function like this
function f(x):
    return 0.3*x+2
//the formula of a line is y = mx + base

3. bias 

4. now we want to see how the perceptron guees the line
for that we need a little equation
so we know 
w0x + w1y + w2b = 0
in order to get the y we do the equation
w/y = -w2b - w0x
y = -(w2/w1)* b - (w0/w1)* x
the b is always 1 so we dont need that in the final code

this math "works" fine, for experience i see two major things
    1 the guess turns negative all the x i put
    2 the guess will not be perfect because we have not enought data for the line to be perfect
