So we understand what a perceptron is, but where is the limit? Perceptron cant solve problems that we can't dive with a line

in boolean table the condition && and || are like this:

AND &&
	True	False
True	True	False
False	False	False

here if the two inputs are true its true but if one is false its false
so we can divide true and false with only one line

OR || 
	True	False
True	True	True
False	True	False

here if just one is true we will get true else its false
again it can divide with one line

but the XOR condition is diferent
heres the table

XOR
	True	False
True	False	True
False	True	False

so here we have the tabel and indicates this
if the both inputs are true then its false
if both are false then its false
but if one is false and the other true its true

This table cant be divide by one line, but it can be divided by two

so how we manege to solve this problem?

XOR conditions in realiti its just !AND AND OR 
and if a single perceptron can distinguis between AND and OR be can do this

input1
		
	(input1 and 2) perceptron(!AND)--------\
						perceptron(AND)
	(input1 and 2) perceptron(OR)----------/

input2
