Perceptron(part1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKn5TPHHAk&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain

Perceptron is a single neuron.

The perceptron gets two inputs (a0 AND a1)
and gives a output (b0 OR b1)
(the the input number can go above 2)



a0_
   \
    neuron/perceptron----b
  _/
a1
the idea is from two inputs we get one output, been this output the good result
for example if the inputs are the position of a point in a table and the output his class,
the perceptron will know if a point is from two classes


INSIDE PERCEPTRON

1.Sum
inputs goes inside the neuron, and the inputs are weighthet when they go in
and the perceptron creates a sum of all of the inputs multiplied by the weights*
a°*w°+x¹*w¹
°248
¹251
*for us to get a correct weight is exist many metohds but starting with random values its fine :)

2.Activation Function 
It conform the output in some disired range
(this case two outputs)
this is easy. SIGN(N) The funciton outpus -1 if n < 0 and outputs 1 if n < 0 (if it's 0 it has to return always the same output)

3.Now we have to train the perceptron to get correct values. We need to have a know training data and we need the perceptron to guess.
With the guess and the correct answer we can calculate the error.
The error is the answer - guess

desired		guess		error
-1		-1		0
-1		+1		-2
+1		-1		+2
+1		+1		0

with this we want to search for the optimal weight. (The weight influences with the output so a correct weight gives a correct output)
if these a mistake i want to change w° = w° + Δw° (we want to sum the weight some valor )
We change the value of Δw° with gradient descent 
Δw° = error * a° * learning rate



¡Learning RATE!

PSEUDO CODE



class Perceptron:

	array[2] weights//w0,w1
	lr = 0.1
	at the start:
		 initialize the weights randomly


	function guess(array[] inputus):
		sum = 0
		for loop all weigths:
			sum += inputs[i] * weights[i]

		return Sign(sum)

	function train(array[] inputs, target):
		guess = guess(inputs)
		error = target - guess

		for loop all weights:
			weights[i] += error * inputs[i] * lr
	

function Sign(n):
	if(n>=0) return 1
	else return 0





//In this example we will have a point in a space, the point will be from class 1 (x>y) or class -1 (x<=y)
//this points will help our perceptron to learn/train
class Point
	x,y,label

	at the start:
		initialize x and y randomly 
		if(x>y) label = 1
		else label = -1
